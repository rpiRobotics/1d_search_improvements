# 1D Search Improvements
Improving the 1D search algorithm in [IK-Geo](https://github.com/rpiRobotics/ik-geo) to achieve high precision and success rate. Testing is performed on the Motoman SIA50D 7-DOF robot arm parameterized by conventional SEW angle with shoulder placed on joint 2.

## Problem formulation
The goal was to achieve 100% empirical success rate over 10,000 random test cases (random joint angles) while minimizing execution time based on the following milestones:
 * 20 Hz,  50 ms ‚Äì GUI display 
 * 100 Hz, 10 ms ‚Äì Mid-range control loop
 * 500 Hz,  2 ms ‚Äì Real-time control loop (stretch goal)

Testing was performed using MATLAB MEX on a computer running Windows 10 on an Intel Core i7-3770K CPU at 3.50 GHz and 16 GB memory.


## Results

With just a few improvements, 1D search performance was significantly improved.  Success rate went from 89% to 100%, and computation time was better than the fastest milestone.

The following improvements were made:
 * Search over only 2 of 4 error function branches. Due to robot symmetry, the four error function branches come in two identical pairs.
 * Use least-squares solutions. This guarantees the error function is always defined, meaning the bracketing method does not fail near endpoints.
 * Search not just for zeros but also for minima / maxima. This improves performance near robot singularities where the error function touches but only barely passes zero. 

## Future work
There are still a number of strategies that may improve 1D search performance even further:
 *  Use multiple unique error functions
 * Hard-code kinematic parameters into code
   *  Or hard code error function with tan‚Å°(ùúÉ/2)
 *  Use intelligent global optimization algorithms (not uniform sampling)
 *  Search for endpoints
     *  Or find endpoints analytically
