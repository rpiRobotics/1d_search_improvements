## Goal
100% empirical success rate in finding all solutions for Motoman SIA50D parameterized by SEW angle in a realistic workspace at > 100 Hz
(Shoulder at joint 2)

![SIA50_500](https://github.com/rpiRobotics/1d_search_improvements/assets/4022499/2b1dc019-30fb-4449-8662-96f6a99b515b)

## Problem
Current C++ implementation of IK for Motoman SIA50D is too slow / misses too many solutions

## Plan
1. Determine benchmark parameters
  * Workspace (Some sphere?)
  * Number of testing points (1000?)
  * Computer to use (CPU speed)
  * Testing procedure (will use MATLAB)
2. Benchmark current performance
3. Apply improvement strategies and measure performance difference
4. Repeat until 100% success at 10 ms
5. Apply changes to C++ implementation

## Computation time milestones
 * 20 Hz,  50 ms ‚Äì GUI display 
 * 100 Hz, 10 ms ‚Äì Mid-range control loop
 * 500 Hz,  2 ms ‚Äì Realtime control loop (stretch goal)

## Strategies to try to improve 1D search performance
 * Utilize robot symmetry (only need half of error branches)
 *  Use multiple unique error functions
 * Hard-code kinematic parameters into code
   *  Or hardcode error function with tan‚Å°(ùúÉ/2)
 *  Use intelligent global optimization algorithms (not uniform sampling)
 *  Search not just for zeros but also for minima / maxima
 *  Search for endpoints
     *  Or use least-squares branches
     *  Or find endpoints analytically
